    "# **Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal:** Thresholding converts an image (usually grayscale) into a **binary image** (pixels are either completely black or completely white).\n",
    "* **Primary Use Case:** It is commonly used for **image segmentation** (separating an object from the background) or preparing images for tasks like OCR (text recognition).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Simple (Global) Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function:** `cv2.threshold(image, threshold_value, max_value, type)`.\n",
    "* **How it Works:**\n",
    "    * You define a single, global **threshold value** (e.g., 80) for the entire image.\n",
    "    * If a pixel value is **below** the threshold, it becomes 0 (black).\n",
    "    * If a pixel value is **above** the threshold, it becomes the `max_value` (usually 255, white).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Limitations:** It fails when lighting is uneven. A single value cannot perfectly separate the object if some parts of the image are shadowed and others are bright.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Adaptive Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Function:** `cv2.adaptiveThreshold(image, max_value, adaptive_method, threshold_type, block_size, C)`.\n",
    "* **How it Works:**\n",
    "    * Instead of one global value, the algorithm calculates a **different threshold for every small region** of the image.\n",
    "    * It uses a \"sliding window\" to examine neighborhoods and determine the ideal threshold for that specific spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Parameters:**\n",
    "    * `block_size`: The size of the neighborhood area used to calculate the threshold (must be an odd number).\n",
    "    * `C`: A constant subtracted from the mean calculation to fine-tune the thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantage:** It is vastly superior for images with shadows or uneven lighting (like scanning a document with poor lighting), where a simple threshold would result in large chunks of black or white data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Example: Bear vs. Text\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Bear (Segmentation):** Simple thresholding worked well to separate a dark bear from a green background because the lighting was relatively consistent.\n",
    "* **The Text (OCR):** Simple thresholding failed on a document image with shadows; no single value could keep all the text visible without blotting out parts of the page. **Adaptive thresholding** successfully isolated all the text regardless of the shadow."
