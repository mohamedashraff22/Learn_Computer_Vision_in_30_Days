    "### What is Pillow (PIL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pillow** (imported as `PIL`) is the \"Python Imaging Library.\" It is one of the most popular libraries in Python for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **OpenCV** is designed for computer vision (analyzing what is inside an image mathematically), **Pillow** is designed for general image handling (cropping, resizing, adding text with custom fonts, converting file formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it used in this specific code?\n",
    "\n",
    "In your specific snippet, Pillow is being used to **convert** the image from OpenCV format to PIL format to use a specific display method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Conversion (`Image.fromarray`):**\n",
    "OpenCV stores images as **NumPy arrays** (grids of numbers). Pillow stores images as **Objects**.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mask_ = Image.fromarray(mask)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This line translates the raw math data from OpenCV into a format Pillow understands.\n",
    "2. **The Display (`mask_.show()`):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mask_.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This command tells Pillow to **open the image using your computer's default image viewer** (like Windows Photo Viewer, Preview on Mac, or Paint).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ A Critical Warning for This Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should remove the Pillow lines from this `while` loop.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `mask_.show()` inside a `while True` loop is **dangerous** for your computer's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`cv2.imshow`** is smart: it updates the *same* window 30 times a second to create a video.\n",
    "* **`mask_.show()`** is not designed for video: it attempts to open a **new** separate window application for *every single frame*.\n",
    "* **Result:** Within a few seconds, your computer will try to open hundreds of image viewer windows, likely causing it to freeze or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "Delete these two lines if you are processing video:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mask_ = Image.fromarray(mask)  # Remove this\n",
    "mask_.show()                   # Remove this (It will crash your PC in a loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stick to `cv2.imshow`, which is optimized for video."

    "Here is your **Pillow (PIL) Crash Course**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While OpenCV is for \"Computer Vision\" (math & analysis), Pillow is for **Image Manipulation** (editing, file handling, and drawing). It is more \"Pythonic\" and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Core Concept: The `Image` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "In OpenCV, images are just NumPy lists of numbers. In Pillow, an image is an **Object**. You must import the `Image` module to do almost anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Opening & Showing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loading:** Supports almost any format (.jpg, .png, .webp, .tiff).\n",
    "* **Showing:** Opens your computer's default photo viewer app (do NOT use in a loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open an image\n",
    "img = Image.open(\"dog.jpg\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show it (Debug only!)\n",
    "img.show() \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Big Difference: RGB vs BGR\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common bug source when mixing libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OpenCV** loads images as **BGR** (Blue, Green, Red).\n",
    "* **Pillow** loads images as **RGB** (Red, Green, Blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to switch between them:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import cv2\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. OpenCV to Pillow (Color fix needed!)\n",
    "cv_img = cv2.imread(\"image.jpg\") # BGR\n",
    "cv_img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(cv_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # Convert to RGB first\n",
    "pil_img = Image.fromarray(cv_img_rgb)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Pillow to OpenCV\n",
    "pil_img = Image.open(\"image.jpg\") # RGB\n",
    "numpy_img = np.array(pil_img) # Convert to math array\n",
    "opencv_img = cv2.cvtColor(numpy_img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR) # Switch back to BGR\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Essential Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Cropping**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow uses coordinates: `(Left, Top, Right, Bottom)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Note:* OpenCV uses Slicing `img[y:y+h, x:x+w]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Crop a box from (100, 100) to (400, 400)\n",
    "cropped_img = img.crop((100, 100, 400, 400))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Resizing**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Resize to 300x200 pixels\n",
    "resized_img = img.resize((300, 200))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Rotation**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Rotate 90 degrees\n",
    "rotated = img.rotate(90)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Drawing (The `ImageDraw` Module)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to draw text, Pillow is often better than OpenCV because it supports **Custom Fonts** (OpenCV only has a few ugly default fonts).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Create a drawing object attached to your image\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Draw a line\n",
    "draw.line((0, 0) + img.size, fill=128, width=5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Draw Text with a font\n",
    "# You can load .ttf files for custom fonts!\n",
    "font = ImageFont.truetype(\"arial.ttf\", size=45)\n",
    "draw.text((10, 10), \"Hello World\", font=font, fill=(255, 0, 0))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Summary: When to use which?\n",
