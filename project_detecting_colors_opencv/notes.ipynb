    "### What is Pillow (PIL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pillow** (imported as `PIL`) is the \"Python Imaging Library.\" It is one of the most popular libraries in Python for opening, manipulating, and saving image files.\n",
    "\n",
    "While **OpenCV** is designed for computer vision (analyzing what is inside an image mathematically), **Pillow** is designed for general image handling (cropping, resizing, adding text with custom fonts, converting file formats).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it used in this specific code?\n",
    "\n",
    "In your specific snippet, Pillow is being used to **convert** the image from OpenCV format to PIL format to use a specific display method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Conversion (`Image.fromarray`):**\n",
    "OpenCV stores images as **NumPy arrays** (grids of numbers). Pillow stores images as **Objects**.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mask_ = Image.fromarray(mask)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This line translates the raw math data from OpenCV into a format Pillow understands.\n",
    "2. **The Display (`mask_.show()`):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mask_.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This command tells Pillow to **open the image using your computer's default image viewer** (like Windows Photo Viewer, Preview on Mac, or Paint).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ A Critical Warning for This Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should remove the Pillow lines from this `while` loop.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `mask_.show()` inside a `while True` loop is **dangerous** for your computer's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`cv2.imshow`** is smart: it updates the *same* window 30 times a second to create a video.\n",
    "* **`mask_.show()`** is not designed for video: it attempts to open a **new** separate window application for *every single frame*.\n",
    "* **Result:** Within a few seconds, your computer will try to open hundreds of image viewer windows, likely causing it to freeze or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "Delete these two lines if you are processing video:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mask_ = Image.fromarray(mask)  # Remove this\n",
    "mask_.show()                   # Remove this (It will crash your PC in a loop)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stick to `cv2.imshow`, which is optimized for video."
