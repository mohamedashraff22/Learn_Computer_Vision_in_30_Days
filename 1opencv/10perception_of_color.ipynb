    "### **The Big Question: Why 3 Dimensions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Observation:** Almost every popular colorspace in computer vision (RGB, BGR, HSV, LAB) utilizes exactly **3 channels** (Dimension 3).\n",
    "* **The Puzzle:** The instructor explored why we need exactly three distinct values to encode \"all\" color information for a standard image, rather than 2, 4, or 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Biological Answer (Trichromacy)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Human Hardware:** The 3-channel standard is not a fundamental law of physics, but a result of **human biology**.\n",
    "* **Cone Cells:** The human eye contains three specific types of photoreceptor cells called **Cones**.\n",
    "* Since our biological \"sensors\" only capture three distinct signal types from the light spectrum, we only need 3 data channels (Red, Green, Blue) to recreate any color a human can perceive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The \"Mantis Shrimp\" Thought Experiment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Different Hardware:** To illustrate this, the instructor compares humans to the **Mantis Shrimp**, which has **16 types** of photoreceptor cells.\n",
    "* **The Implications:** If Mantis Shrimps invented computers and OpenCV, their standard images would likely require **16 channels** to accurately represent the world as they see it. Our 3-channel images would look \"black and white\" or severely lacking in detail to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Vision is heavily modeled on **Human Vision**. Understanding that our digital tools (like OpenCV) are designed around human biological limitations can help you grasp why certain algorithms function the way they do.\n"
