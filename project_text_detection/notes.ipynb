    "# **Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal:** Implement text detection using three different OCR technologies and compare their performance using a specific similarity metric.\n",
    "* **Environment:** The project is executed in **Google Colab**, utilizing data stored in **Google Drive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset:** A custom dataset comprising images containing text (e.g., \"Collect moments not things\").\n",
    "* **Labeling:** The filename of each image corresponds exactly to the text written in the image (ground truth).\n",
    "* **Source:** Images were sourced from Pexels.\n",
    "* **Alternatives:** While complex datasets like **COCO-Text** exist, this tutorial uses simpler images with clear text to make the metric comparison more straightforward.\n",
    "* **Setup:**\n",
    "* Data is zipped and uploaded to Google Drive.\n",
    "* Drive is mounted in Colab, and the data is unzipped for local access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The following Python libraries are installed:\n",
    "* `pytesseract` (for Tesseract)\n",
    "* `easyocr`\n",
    "* `boto3` (for AWS Textract)\n",
    "* `pillow` (image processing)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Tesseract OCR Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wrapper:** Uses `pytesseract` (uses tesseract under the hood) to interface with the Tesseract engine.\n",
    "* **Method:** `pytesseract.image_to_string(image, lang='eng')`.\n",
    "* **Observation:** The out-of-the-box performance on raw scene images was very poor.\n",
    "* **Note:** Tesseract generally requires significant image preprocessing and configuration tuning to work well, but this experiment tested it on raw input intentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. EasyOCR Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Method:**\n",
    "* Initialize a `Reader` object for English (`['en']`).\n",
    "* Call `reader.readtext(image_path)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Output:** Returns a list containing the bounding box, detected text, and confidence score.\n",
    "* **Parsing:** The code iterates through the results to concatenate detected words into a single string.\n",
    "* **Observation:** Performed significantly better than raw Tesseract but still had minor inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. AWS Textract Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AWS Setup:**\n",
    "* Create an **IAM User** with `AmazonTextractFullAccess` policy.\n",
    "* Generate **Access Key** and **Secret Access Key** (Security warning: keep these private).\n",
    "* *Note:* This service is not free; it is pay-per-use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code:**\n",
    "* Use `boto3.client('textract')` with credentials and region (e.g., `us-east-1`).\n",
    "* Call `client.detect_document_text` passing the image bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parsing:** Iterate through the response blocks; if the `BlockType` is `'LINE'`, append the text.\n",
    "* **Observation:** Provided the most accurate raw detections among the three.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Comparison Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Metric:** **Jaccard Similarity Index**.\n",
    "* Logic: (Intersection of words) / (Union of words).\n",
    "* Calculates how many words the prediction and ground truth have in common relative to the total unique words.\n",
    "* A function was generated using ChatGPT to compute this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Preprocessing for Evaluation:**\n",
    "* Both ground truth (filename) and predictions were converted to **lowercase**.\n",
    "* Special characters (periods, question marks, exclamation points, newlines) were removed to ensure fair comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Execution:** The script iterates through all 100 images, calculates the score for each tool, and computes the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The average Jaccard Similarity scores for this specific dataset (raw scene text without preprocessing) were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tesseract:** ~0.01 (Lowest performance on raw data).\n",
    "* **EasyOCR:** ~0.21 (Moderate performance).\n",
    "* **AWS Textract:** ~0.34 (Highest performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** For this specific experiment using raw images without preprocessing, **AWS Textract** outperformed the open-source alternatives. However, Tesseract is noted to be powerful if the data is properly preprocessed."
